        "# Monte Carlo Algorithms in Connect4\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore Monte Carlo Tree Search in the classic Connect4 game! If you are unfamiliar with the game, you can find the [rules](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/ConnectFour.PDF) here and [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylZBRUJi3UQ) a live playing of the game here.\n",

        "## Game Model\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we will construct our game state being the Connect4 board! Some key features we want to record in our board are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Current turn (P1 or P2)\n",
        "* Terminal state\n",
        "* All the positions of the pieces\n",
        "  * Differentiating P1 and P2 piece\n",
        "* Rewards of state!\n",
        "  * (+1) for Player 1 win\n",
        "  * (-1) for Player 2 win\n",
        "  * (0) for tie! or non-terminal\n",
        "\n",
        "One implementation feature to note is that we keep track of each columns height. This makes it easier for us to resolve where a new piece will go into a column as well as whether the column is full. The time complexity goes from O(Board_Height) to O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another item to note is that win conditions can only change around the most recently played piece. That is, a Connect4 state will only go terminal if the most recently played piece directly caused it to go terminal by a win/tie condition. Therefore, we are able to exploit this fact and whenever we want to check whether a player has won, we only need to look around the most recently played piece in all 4 directions (up-down, left-right, both diagonals). The time complexity goes from O(Board_Height * Board_Width) to O(1).\n",
        "\n",
        "These optimizations help the game run faster and thus allow more time for the Monte Carlo Tree Search to learn later on! This is especially important if you decide to make the board much bigger than a simple 7x6."

        "\n",
        "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a decision-making algorithm widely used in artificial intelligence, especially for games like Go and Chess. It strikes a balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known strategies. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Selection**: Starting from the root node (the current state), the algorithm selects the most promising child node based on a specific criterion, such as the Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees (UCT). This balances the exploration of less visited nodes and the exploitation of nodes with a high win rate. The formula is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "![picture](https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFPTK.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expansion**: Upon reaching a leaf node (a state where the outcome is not yet known), the algorithm expands the tree by adding one or more child nodes, representing possible future states.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simulation**: From the newly added nodes, the algorithm simulates random play-outs or games to the end, using a default or random policy to make decisions. This step estimates the value of the new node.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Backpropagation**: Finally, the results of these simulations are propagated back up the tree. Each node is updated with the new information, such as the win/loss ratio, helping to refine the decision-making process for future iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "MCTS iteratively runs through these steps, building a tree of possibilities, until a termination condition is met such as a time limit or iteration count. This method allows AI to handle games with vast numbers of possible moves by focusing on the most promising strategies.\n",
        "\n",

        "By following through this tutorial you will have learned how Monte Carlo Tree Search works by traversing through a tree using exploitation & exploration, then expanding the tree, simulating a playout of the game, and updating the rewards up the path. A big advantage of Monte Carlo Tree Search is that we the flexibility of changing the amount of time it learns depending on the desired use case! There is a tradeoff between time and performance as seen by the examples above. This tutorial also gives guidance on how to design a  state for any type of AI algorithm.\n",

        "## Future Extensions\n",
        "\n",
        "Some interesting extensions to this baseline tutorial include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expectimax or Neural Net**: I believe that it is possible for a different algorithm to truly find the optimal move for Connect4 in a reasonable amount of time. It has been concluded that the game is solved with a first mover advantage. That is, under optimal play the first player will always win! The MCTS algorithm was still close to a 50/50 split when playing against itself even though Player 1 should in theory win 100% of the time. Therefore some other algorithms like Expectimax to find the value of each state or possibly training a neural network would be better!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Greedy Algorithm Improvements**: Currently, the greedy algorithm only considers whether its move is going to result in a terminal state in the current or next turn and takes action to maximize its own rewards. Otherwise, it randomly places pieces. One improvement that could be made to the greedy algorithm could involve prioritizing putting pieces where they are connecting to other of your own pieces since that is the win condition of the game after all.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Connect4 Variants**: All of the examples in the tutorial are based on the standard Connect4 game size of 7 width and 6 height. It could be interesting to change some of the rules of the game and see how that influences the effectiveness of MCTS, changes the rate of ties, and changes the bias towards P1 winning. Factors that could be changed include the board size (both width and height), the win condition (Connect4 → Connect5), the turn mechanism (each player has 2 sequential turns instead), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **MCTS Improvements**: Improve efficiency of MCTS by only allowing 1-1 mapping of state to MCTS node. Throughout all the possible different playouts of Connect4, there are numerous ways in which we can end up in a particular game state. Currently, these nodes are all separated throughout the tree even though they represent the same underlying game state. One way to improve the efficiency of the tree search, we could combine all these nodes so that they are better able to use the simulation data!\n"
